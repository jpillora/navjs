# Nav.js

A vanilla JavaScript library to automate the generation of complex navigation menus

## The Problem

For pages with large portions of content, like: long blog posts, technical documentation, 
online books, etc. we'll most like want a comprehensive table of contents (or a *set* of navigation menus)
to assist discovery. Although keeping this long list of links in sync with the actual content is
laborious task, so, JavaScript to the rescue.

## The Solution

**Nav.js** - We'll run:

``` js
Nav("div#nav");
```

On our page, with content:

``` html
<div id="nav"></div>
<div data-nav="Home">...</div>
<div data-nav="Projects">...</div>
<div data-nav="Contact">...</div>
```

Which will provide `div#nav` with the following `ul`:
``` html
<div id="nav">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
    <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

Essentially performing the **only** the "Add Markup" portion of
[Responsive Nav's Instructions](http://responsive-nav.com/#instructions).
Since this library has no opinions on styling, it may be used with any CSS framework.
